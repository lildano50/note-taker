# Note Taker App

## User Story

As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Description

This app allows the user to input a title and description of notes and save them to a list. Notes are stored in a JSON file that can be referenced later, if desired. 

## Acceptance Criteria

- [] When the user opens the Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- [] When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- [] When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
- [] When the user clicks on the Save button, the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
- [] When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
- [] When the user clicks on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears


## Expected Outcome

A simple note taker/reminder app where the user can enter a title and text and save the note to a column on the right hand side. The API containing the notes can be referenced if desired as well.
